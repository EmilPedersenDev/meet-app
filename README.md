# meet-app

## Description
A team page that displays all the employees of the company. You can search, sort, get detailed information of every employee etc.

## Implementation

### Stories
A modern and responsive design - I wanted to make the app work on all devices.

No Bootstrap - I usually use boostrap for layout between devices, but i chose not to use it to make it more challenging for myself.

Sort by name/office and filter by name/office/contact - This makes it easier for the user to navigate and explore the team page.

Avaliable on Github - So you can get a demo and see the end result without the need to run the project locally.

Infinite scroll - Render images on scroll to avoid render all images at the same time. This makes the page feel faster.

Works in Chrome, Firefox, IE11 - This is to not be dependent on certain browsers. You never know what the user uses.
